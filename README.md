Overview of Project Layout

•	OmniDataService imported into data manipulation scripts to handle repeated data collection instances. Includes web-scraping, pandas data frame creation, saving df to csv, and csv back to df.

•	Data Manipulation Scripts - Each member should create their own branch following the naming convention 'name_branch'. Do not update to the main branch without discussing it with rest of the team. Make sure to make use of csv files to save your datasets, but do not upload your data files to the branch to maintain a smaller branch size.

•	Machine Learning Model Generation Scripts - Also include your model scripts in your branch. 

Note: Since it is a group project we can and should copy ideas and code chunks from each other. Please make sure to name your files appropriately so that everyone can tell by the file what the script does (data manipulation, model generation, etc.). An example might be data_prep.py. Please do not push to other people's branches.

Please do not push to main branch.
